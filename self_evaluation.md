# Arrays Self - Evaluation

**How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?**

I feel pretty confident! I definitely have a few questions that I will remember for our next session, but everything is making sense so far!

**Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?**

Before Thursday's session I would love to spend some more time playing around with different arrays methods. It was helpful for me to learn by doing in the exercise, but I want to go through a few more just to get more comfortable with the content.

**What questions do you have about Arrays?**

I have a good general understanding of index positions, but one thing that confused me was the slice method.

The following example was from my arrays.js practice file, and printed to my console [15, 3].

 ```javascript
var ages = [10, 15, 3, 12]
 console.log(ages.slice(1, 3));

 ```
Based on my understanding of index positions, index position 1 is 15 and index position 3 is 12, so why is this my output?

Also, the slice command has only worked for me within the console.log command. Is that because this is solely an informative command?
